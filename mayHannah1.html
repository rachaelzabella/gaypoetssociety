<h1>Purgatory in the West <i>by Hannah</i></h1>

<pre style="text-align: left;">
The boy looks at that fire-hot sky- midday desert. The landscape of the endless abyss: empty and his. The boy ain’t got no road to
guide him so the boy guides himself, marks the progress through changing mountains. The boy don’t need a compass to guide his way, this
place is self-explanatory. 

The wolves stalk him, the sun beats him, the wind lashes him: home comforts. He looks at the massive star that ruptures the land and
wonders if it was an act of God or the devil that brought him back to this deadman’s land. There ain’t no God in the desert, Jesus
weren’t tempted by God, only the devil came to him in this place. No God wants to see this unfinished land that He forgot to finish.

He ran from those neglected homes to this new one: the flurry and fury of old men killing each other. Maybe home for him is this
carcass of a drought, maybe home ain’t home anymore. Maybe it's death. 

On the road there is an old man, mule by his side, whining.

‘You lost, son?’ The man whispers and it travels on the sand to the boy's ears. 

‘Ain’t lost, just walking.’ 

‘Walking to where?’

‘Don’t know yet.’

‘That sounds like lost to me.’

The boy has stopped a couple paces away from the old man. His face is wrinkled, his skin tanned leather, rough and tough. He wears no
shoes- probably ate them, hunger makes men do worse things and this land ain’t enough to sustain anyone. Covering his head is a wide
brimmed hat, looks nice enough. For a moment the boy thinks about stabbing him with his pocket knife so he can take the hat and mule;
it might make the journey a little easier. What would the hassle be- old man, no one around, easy kill and maybe something to eat. 

‘I know what you’re thinking, boy. Don’t try it.’

‘How you know what I think?’

‘Just do- ain’t difficult for me.’

The boy flopped onto the ground and the man moved to sit with him. 

‘You got water?’

‘No water for miles.’ 

‘I’m dyin’ of thirst.’

‘No you ain’t.’ 

The boy tried to spit onto the ground next to his feet but his mouth was so dry that nothing came out. No water, the air itself felt
like breathing in the sand. Looking out on the land the boy felt like he’d seen it all before, each step he took went nowhere; he’d
always be in this wasteland waiting for something to come his way. Maybe the old man was the closest he’d get to anything like the land
he’d left. The old man must have come from somewhere, somewhere the boy could go. 

‘How long you been travelling.’

‘Since the start.’

‘The start of what?’

‘Just the start.’ 

‘I’m hopin’ to find somewhere to drink and sleep, away from the wolves, you know anywhere?’

‘There ain’t nowhere you can go. This is it, boy. You’re here. You ain’t leaving- ever.’

The boy turned to the man. His face was covered by the hat, only the sliver of his lower mouth could be seen, lips upturned in a smile. 

‘You wanna sit with me for awhile?’ Asked the old man.

‘Ain’t nothing else to do I suppose.’ 

They sat together, the sun beating down on their skin, hellfire. The boy wondered if night would ever come. The boy wondered if night
had ever come in the first place.
